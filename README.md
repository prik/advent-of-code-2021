# Advent of Code 2021

This repo contains my solutions to some of the puzzles this fun game has to provide.
It is written in TypeScript, which is the first time for me working with it, so I got to learn lots of stuff along the way.

### Usage

After cloning the repo, install the dependencies:

```
yarn
```

To run the scripts, replace `X` with the corresponding values:

```
npx ts-node day-X/part-X.ts
```
